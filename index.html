                        <p><b>ATTSAUL ARTS AND CULTURE FORUM </b> was established in Attridgeville/Saulsville (Phelindaba) township of Tswhane to develop and create opportunities for our community especially youth in arts, culture and heritage sector.
                        Registered in 2015, the forum aims to develop and assist in job creation for the artists. 
                        South Africa has high levels of unemployment and drugs related problems, this is particularly true for the youth of our country. It is in the rural and township areas of this country that have been particularly hit by the scourge.
                        <b>ATTSAUL ARTS AND CULTURE FOURM </b> will implement programmes, which we aim to start as soon we get the resources in place. Workshops will be conducted in different schools and community at large to highlight the need for training in arts, culture and heritage sector. 
                        The training will be accredited; they will also take place in the afternoon (after school) and Saturdays in order to accommodate daily school goers. We would also like to RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning) our artist since most of them can assist in training if assessed against their skill and certificated. </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>Most importantly, this will be the beginning of the steps to establish the Arena as Arts and culture business hub ,we aim to initiate events to encourage participation by creating  on-going platforms to allow artists their first real opportunity to start business in this facility which will attract tourism and community as customers.
